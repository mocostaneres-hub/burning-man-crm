# üö® URGENT: Vercel Needs Redeploy

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Backend (Railway)**: Fully working
- Event creation: ‚úÖ Working
- User campId: ‚úÖ Set correctly
- Database: ‚úÖ MongoDB connected

‚ùå **Frontend (Vercel)**: Using old build
- Socket.IO: ‚ùå Still trying `localhost:5001`
- Should be: `https://burning-man-crm-production.up.railway.app`

## The Issue

The frontend code is trying to connect Socket.IO to `localhost:5001` because:
1. Either `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL` is not set in Vercel, OR
2. The frontend was built before the environment variable was added

## Solution

### Option 1: Verify & Redeploy via Vercel Dashboard

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select project: `burning-man-crm`

2. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Verify `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL` exists with value:
     ```
     https://burning-man-crm-production.up.railway.app
     ```
   - Make sure it's enabled for: Production, Preview, Development

3. **Trigger Redeploy**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click the 3 dots (‚ãØ) on the latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes

### Option 2: Force Redeploy via Git

If the environment variable is correctly set, force a redeploy:

```bash
cd /Users/mauricio/burning-man-crm
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force Vercel redeploy to pick up REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result After Redeploy

- ‚úÖ No more `localhost:5001` errors in console
- ‚úÖ Socket.IO connects to Railway backend
- ‚úÖ Event creation works without errors
- ‚úÖ Real-time features functional

## Debug: Check Current Frontend Environment

After redeploy, open browser console on https://burning-man-crm.vercel.app and check:
- Should see: `API Service initialized with baseURL: https://burning-man-crm-production.up.railway.app/api`
- Should NOT see: `localhost:5001` anywhere

**The event creation IS working on the backend - you just need the frontend to be rebuilt with the correct environment variables!** üöÄ
