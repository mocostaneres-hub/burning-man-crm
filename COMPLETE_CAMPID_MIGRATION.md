## 🛡️ SECURITY TRANSFORMATION

### BEFORE (INSECURE)
```javascript
// ❌ Mutable email - DANGEROUS!
const camp = await db.findCamp({ contactEmail: req.user.email });
if (camp.contactEmail !== req.user.email) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
}
```

**Vulnerabilities:**
- 🚨 Email change breaks authorization
- 🚨 Race conditions
- 🚨 Data integrity issues
- 🚨 Authorization bypass potential

### AFTER (SECURE)
```javascript
// ✅ Immutable campId - SECURE!
const { getUserCampId, canAccessCamp } = require('../utils/permissionHelpers');

const campId = await getUserCampId(req);
const hasAccess = await canAccessCamp(req, targetCampId);
if (!hasAccess) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Immutable identifier
- ✅ No race conditions
- ✅ Consistent authorization
- ✅ Secure by design

## 🔧 HELPER FUNCTIONS

### `getUserCampId(req)`
**Purpose:** Get camp ID for authenticated user

**Logic:**
1. Primary: Uses `req.user.campId` (from JWT)
2. Fallback: Looks up by email (backwards compatibility)
3. Returns: Camp ID string or null

**Usage:** 40+ locations

---

### `canAccessCamp(req, targetCampId)`
**Purpose:** Verify camp ownership

**Logic:**
1. Checks camp account type
2. Gets user's camp ID
3. Compares with target camp ID
4. Returns: Boolean

**Usage:** 20+ locations

---

### `requireCampAccount(req, res, next)`
**Purpose:** Middleware to ensure camp account

**Usage:** Can be added to route definitions

---

### `requireCampOwnership(req, res, next)`
**Purpose:** Middleware to verify camp ownership from params

**Usage:** Can be added to route definitions
