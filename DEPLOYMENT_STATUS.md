# Deployment Status & Checklist

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Time**: ~23:00 UTC

---

## 🚨 **Issue:**
Railway API backend hasn't deployed in 16 hours despite multiple changes today.

---

## ✅ **What Should Be Deployed:**

### **Backend Changes (Railway):**
1. ✅ Rate limiting configuration updates
2. ✅ CORS configuration for localhost origins
3. ✅ OAuth route improvements
4. ✅ Onboarding endpoints
5. ✅ Mock database role field support
6. ✅ Authentication middleware improvements

### **Frontend Changes (Vercel):**
1. ✅ Fixed AuthContext race condition
2. ✅ Fixed Login page footer alignment
3. ✅ Fixed Register page redirect logic
4. ✅ Onboarding role selection page
5. ✅ About G8Road page with mockups
6. ✅ Public camp discovery page
7. ✅ Footer component updates
8. ✅ Privacy Policy & Terms of Service pages

---

## 🔧 **Railway Configuration Check:**

### **Required Environment Variables:**
- ✅ `MONGODB_URI` - Set to: `mongodb://mongo:aWAjWkGLSDnmvYVDRFAZtrbfGJyQO0wB@yamanote.proxy.rlwy.net:41945`
- ✅ `JWT_SECRET` - Should be configured
- ✅ `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - For OAuth
- ✅ `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - For OAuth
- ⚠️ `PORT` - Railway auto-assigns (no action needed)
- ⚠️ `CLIENT_URL` - Should point to Vercel frontend
- ⚠️ `CORS_ORIGIN` - Should point to Vercel frontend

### **Deployment Settings:**
- Start command: `node server/index.js` (from package.json `"start"` script)
- Build command: None needed (Node.js doesn't require build)
- Root directory: `/` (project root)

---

## 📋 **Action Items:**

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Verify GitHub Connection:**
   - Go to Railway dashboard → Your project → Settings
   - Check if "Source" is connected to GitHub repo
   - Ensure "Auto Deploy" is enabled for `main` branch

2. **Manual Deploy Trigger (If Auto-Deploy Isn't Working):**
   - Railway dashboard → Your project → Deployments
   - Click "Deploy" button
   - Select `main` branch

3. **Check Recent Commits Were Pushed:**
   - Recent commits should include:
     - "Fix: Existing users incorrectly redirected to onboarding page"
     - "Trigger Railway deployment - add deployment documentation"

4. **Verify Environment Variables:**
   - Especially `MONGODB_URI` - this was just configured
   - Missing variables will cause deployment to fail

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Railway Still Won't Deploy:**

1. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Railway dashboard → Deployments → Click on failed/pending deployment
   - Look for errors in build or deploy logs

2. **Common Issues:**
   - ❌ Missing environment variables
   - ❌ Port binding issues (Railway provides `$PORT`)
   - ❌ MongoDB connection failures
   - ❌ GitHub webhook not configured
   - ❌ Build command fails

3. **Force Redeploy:**
   - Settings → Redeploy latest deployment
   - Or: Make a trivial change and push

---

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Deployment:**

✅ Backend API responds at Railway URL  
✅ MongoDB connection successful (no more mock database fallback)  
✅ OAuth endpoints work correctly  
✅ Onboarding role selection endpoints functional  
✅ CORS allows requests from Vercel frontend  

---

## 📞 **Next Steps:**

1. Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
2. If deployment failed, check logs for specific errors
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Test API endpoints after successful deployment

**Last Push**: Just now (added this documentation + trigger file)  
**GitHub Branch**: `main`  
**Expected Deploy Time**: 2-5 minutes after push
